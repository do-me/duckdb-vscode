# Change Log

All notable changes to the "duckdb" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Editable SQL modal** — every "View SQL" / "SQL Preview" modal is now a SQL editor: tweak the query and press ⌘↵ / Ctrl+↵ to run it in place. Works for the file overview preview, the original-query modal in the results table, and the filtered/sorted full-query modal. "Open in Editor" now uses the edited text. Tab inserts spaces.
- **Land directly on data** — opening a `.parquet` (or other data file) now jumps straight into the data view instead of the schema overview. The schema view is still one click away via "Back to Overview".
- New `duckdb.fileViewer.openMode` setting (`data` | `schema`, default `data`) and `duckdb.fileViewer.openRowLimit` (default `0` = unlimited) to control the new landing behaviour.
- Skeleton-cell shimmer for rows whose chunk hasn't arrived yet — visible while you scroll faster than chunks fetch.

### Changed
- **Virtualized infinite scroll for results.** Auto-open no longer applies a `LIMIT` by default; the full result set is materialized into a DuckDB temp table and rows are streamed into the viewport on demand in 100-row chunks. Only the rows currently in (or near) the viewport live in the DOM, so scrolling 10M rows does not OOM the webview. A bounded LRU chunk cache (~80 chunks ≈ 8k rows) keeps memory flat as you scroll. Pagination buttons are gone — the scrollbar maps directly to the full result set.
- `duckdb.pageSize` now defaults to `100` (the chunk size for infinite scroll) instead of `1000`.
- The data viewer's refresh button now re-runs the most recent query (default top-N, ad-hoc edit, or column selection) instead of dropping back to the schema view.
- The `requestPage` IPC echoes a `requestVersion` so chunk responses from prior sort/filter contexts are dropped instead of corrupting the cache.
- DuckDB now spills to a per-process subdirectory under `<os.tmpdir>/duckdb-vscode/pid-<pid>-<random>/` (created via `mkdtempSync`); the directory is removed on extension shutdown so spill files don't accumulate across sessions. User-configured `duckdb.tempDirectory` is respected and never deleted.
- Bumped `@duckdb/node-api` from `1.4.3-r.3` to `1.5.2-r.1`.

### Fixed
- When an auto-loaded query errors out, a "Back to Schema" recovery button appears so the session is not stuck on the error screen.

### Notes
- `Cmd+A` followed by Copy on a huge result set is intentionally capped at 10,000 rows (with a trailing `-- truncated` marker). For full exports, use the **Copy Table** / **Export** buttons in the footer — those use the server-side copy path and respect `duckdb.maxCopyRows`.

### Added (continued)
- **Resizable row-number gutter.** Default width now scales with the digit count of the current result set (so `10,000,000` doesn't clip), and a drag handle on the `#` header lets you resize it like any other column. Row indexes are formatted with thousands separators.
- **Editable cells with save-to-file.** Double-click a cell in the data viewer to open the expansion modal in **edit** mode — type the new value and press ⌘↵ (or click Save) to persist. Save UPDATEs the in-memory DuckDB cache and rewrites the source file via `COPY ... TO 'tmp'` followed by an atomic rename, so a crash mid-write can never corrupt the original. Empty input means NULL; `TRY_CAST` makes type-incompatible input fall back to NULL instead of erroring. Supported formats: `parquet`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `jsonl`, `ndjson`. Editing is gated to safe contexts only — disabled when the cache is a derived projection, a `LIMIT`-sampled load, an ad-hoc SQL result, or an `xlsx` sheet (no DuckDB write support). Complex types (`LIST`, `STRUCT`, `MAP`) are read-only for now.

## [0.0.24] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Excel file support** — `.xlsx` files now open directly in the DuckDB data viewer. Workbooks with multiple sheets show a container overview with expandable column previews per sheet; click "Open" to explore any sheet with full column stats, pagination, sorting, filtering, and export.
- New `duckdb.fileViewer.excel` setting (default: on) to control auto-opening `.xlsx` files
- The DuckDB `excel` extension is auto-installed and loaded on first `.xlsx` open
- `read_xlsx` added to SQL autocomplete suggestions
- Added `"Data Science"` marketplace category and `excel`, `xlsx`, `spreadsheet`, `sql` keywords for discoverability

### Internal
- Zero-dependency xlsx sheet name reader (`xlsxSheetReader.ts`) — parses ZIP central directory + `xl/workbook.xml` using only Node builtins (`fs` + `zlib`)
- New `ContainerOverview` React component and `setupMultiTableOverviewWebview` handler for multi-table file types
- `MultiTableDataSource` interface in `overviewHandler.ts` for future `.db`/`.duckdb` file support

## [0.0.23] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Parquet key-value metadata viewer (click metadata count in file overview header)

### Fixed
- File/table explorer no longer loses state when panel is unfocused
- Minor style fix with fuzzy search highlighting

## [0.0.22] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Schema Overview**: data files and database tables/views now open to a landing page showing table metadata, column summaries (type, distinct count, null %), and a sample-data preview
- **Table/View Explorer**: browse database tables and views via "Open Table" in the explorer — opens a virtual file with the same overview + results experience as data files
- **Columns Panel**: fuzzy search across columns, expandable column details with type icons, copy column name, and click-to-filter
- "View SQL" modal showing the generated query for any overview
- `FileOverview` and `ColumnsPanel` components shared across data files and database tables

### Changed
- `DataFileEditorProvider` and new `TableEditorProvider` share common overview logic via `overviewHandler`

## [0.0.21] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Resource management settings**: `duckdb.maxMemory` and `duckdb.tempDirectory` for controlling DuckDB memory and disk usage
- **Inline loading indicator**: shows a spinner decoration on the executing statement while a query is running

## [0.0.20] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- DuckDB in-process memory now capped to fit within VS Code extension host limits (prevents out-of-memory crashes)
- Updated marketplace keywords

## [0.0.19] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Data File Viewer**: open `.parquet`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, and `.ndjson` files directly in the DuckDB results view — no more "binary file" errors for Parquet, and CSV files render as a rich data table out of the box
- Parquet and CSV/TSV auto-open with DuckDB by default; JSON/JSONL available via **Open With… → DuckDB Data Viewer**
- New settings to control auto-open behavior:
  - `duckdb.fileViewer.parquet` (default: on)
  - `duckdb.fileViewer.csv` (default: on)
  - `duckdb.fileViewer.json` (default: off — plain `.json` is never auto-opened to avoid disrupting config files)
- Full results experience for data files: pagination, sorting, filtering, column stats, export, and refresh all work the same as regular query results

## [0.0.18] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Column number formatting bug in filter popovers and histograms

### Changed
- Added proper type-checking (`tsc --noEmit`) to the build process
- Updated README with new demo GIFs (live preview, Parquet querying)

## [0.0.17] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- Peek view edge case bugs

## [0.0.16] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Peek Results**: new "Peek" CodeLens action on every SQL statement — runs the query and shows results inline in a VS Code peek view as a formatted ASCII table
- **Live Preview**: while a peek view is open, editing the SQL document automatically re-executes and refreshes the preview (debounced, configurable via `duckdb.peekResults.debounceMs`)
- **Run Statement at Cursor** command (`Cmd+Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`) — executes the single statement under the cursor without selecting it
- **Result summary in CodeLens**: after execution, each statement shows its row count and timing inline (e.g. `✓ 42 rows (12.3ms)`) — click to peek
- **Extension auto-load management**: "Add to Auto-load" and "Remove from Auto-load" context menu actions in the Extensions panel; new `duckdb.extensions.autoLoad` setting replaces the old `duckdb.extensions` array (auto-migrated)
- **Load Extension** context menu action for installed-but-not-loaded extensions
- **HTTP safety guard**: live preview detects HTTP/S3/cloud URLs and pauses execution if `cache_httpfs` is not loaded, offering a one-click install
- `cache_httpfs` added to the common extensions quick-pick list

### Changed
- **Theme-aware result panel**: all hardcoded colors replaced with VS Code CSS variables (`--vscode-*`), so the results webview adapts to any theme (light, dark, high contrast)
- Font family and size now inherit from the editor via `--vscode-editor-font-family` and `--vscode-editor-font-size`
- Extension installation now tries the core repository first, then automatically falls back to the community repository (no manual flag needed)
- "Add Extension…" renamed to "Install Extension…" in the Extensions panel
- Extensions explorer now shows auto-load status in the description and richer Markdown tooltips
- Autocomplete skips `DESCRIBE` for remote HTTP/S3 sources when `cache_httpfs` is not loaded, avoiding unwanted network requests during typing

### Internal
- New `ResultDocumentProvider` — virtual document provider for the `duckdb-results://` URI scheme used by peek views
- New `resultCacheService` — in-memory LRU cache (50 entries) storing recent query results keyed by document URI + statement offset
- `parseSqlStatements` and `getCachedResultsForDoc` exported from their respective modules for reuse
- `databaseManager` exposes `engineType` on `CombinedDatabaseInfo` for future use

## [0.0.15] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Find Table/View search in database explorer (quick pick across all databases and schemas)
- Search History command with quick pick (Run Again, Open in Editor, Copy SQL actions)
- Expandable column stats in explorer tree (Type, Min, Max, Unique, Nulls via SUMMARIZE)
- "Copy as INSERT" and "Copy as CREATE TABLE" context menu actions on tables/views
- "Hide Schema" context menu action with `duckdb.explorer.ignoredSchemas` setting
- "Show Hidden Schemas..." command to restore hidden schemas
- Auto-refresh explorer after DDL/DML statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, etc.)

### Changed
- "Select Column" replaced with "Select Distinct Values" (GROUP BY + COUNT, sorted by frequency)
- "Select Top 100" renamed to "Select Top Rows" with configurable limit via `duckdb.explorer.defaultRowLimit` (default: 1000)
- Single-schema databases now skip the schema level in the explorer tree (fewer clicks)
